# Disjunctive 'or'
Project in collaboration with Alexia Hernandez, Sarang Jeong, Emily Goodwin, Arto Anttila, and Jiayi Lu on agreement with disjunctive "or" in English. For example, some speakers produce sentences such as:
> "Either the students or I **are** eating the meal" (possibly using default 'are' as an unmarked variant)

Others produce agreements such as:

> "Either the students or I **am** eating the meal" (closest conjunct agreement) 

This project collects large-scale data from English-speaking participants in order to elucidate the distribution of possible grammars, employing an Optimality Theory based approach to derive the observed variation between grammars.

## Navigating the Repository

### Experiments

All experimental materials are located in the "Experiments" folder. Within this folder are 2 folders for each of the experiments we have run to date. They are as follows:

**01_3P_Production**: This experiment investigated only how participants conjugate the copular verb in sentences with two third-person conjuncts, either in the singular or plural. For example: "Either John or those boys %is,are% interviewing the movie star" or "Either Harry or Ahmad %is,are% investigating the crime scene". This folder contains a subfolder called "stimuli creation" that includes all materials used to generate the stimuli in the experiment.

**02_AllN_Productoin**: This experiment replicates the above, but introduces additional conjuncts in the form of the first person singular and plural pronominals, resulting in 12 possible combinations. For example: "Either we or the sailor %is,are,am% pleading with the Prime Minister" or "Either the zombies or I %is,are,am% writing a self-help book" in addition to the conditions detailed above in 01_3P_Production. This folder contains a subfolder called "stimuli creation" that includes all materials used to generate the stimuli in the experiment.

### Analysis

This folder contains all analysis scripts used in this project. Within this folder are 3 folders: one for each of the experiments, and one that includes the CoGeTo analysis of our OT.

### Corpus

This folder contains all the data-collection and analysis scripts for the corpus work. Corpus_creation contains the script for extracting disjunction examples, Data subdirectory contains the extracted examples, and analysis subdirectory contains the R scripts for analysis and plotting.

### Output

This folder contains all papers, publications, conference slides, etc. related to this project. Currently this folder contains our abstract and slides from our 2025 LSA talk.
