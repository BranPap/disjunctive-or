## Navigating the Repository

### Experiments

All experimental materials are located in the "Experiments" folder. Within this folder are 2 folders for each of the experiments we have run to date. They are as follows:

**01_3P_Production**: This experiment investigated only how participants conjugate the copular verb in sentences with two third-person conjuncts, either in the singular or plural. For example: "Either John or those boys %is,are% interviewing the movie star" or "Either Harry or Ahmad %is,are% investigating the crime scene". This folder contains a subfolder called "stimuli creation" that includes all materials used to generate the stimuli in the experiment.

**02_AllN_Productoin**: This experiment replicates the above, but introduces additional conjuncts in the form of the first person singular and plural pronominals, resulting in 12 possible combinations. For example: "Either we or the sailor %is,are,am% pleading with the Prime Minister" or "Either the zombies or I %is,are,am% writing a self-help book" in addition to the conditions detailed above in 01_3P_Production. This folder contains a subfolder called "stimuli creation" that includes all materials used to generate the stimuli in the experiment.
