(3S or 3S, am) -> (3S or 3S, is )
- The antecedent difference vectors are the following:
    C(3S or 3S, am, is ) = [-1. -1.  0.]
    C(3S or 3S, am, are (null)) = [ 0.  0. -1.]
  and the consequent difference vectors are the following:
    C(3S or 3S, is , am) = [1. 1. 0.]
    C(3S or 3S, is , are (null)) = [ 1.  1. -1.]
- Is the antecedent mapping feasible?
    The antecedent mapping is HG UNfeasible and therefore also OT UNfeasible.
- Does the categorical trivial sufficient condition without rescaling hold?
    YES, because each consequent difference vector can be paired up with a
    smaller antecedent difference vector (possibly with repetitions), for instance as follows:
      consequent C(3S or 3S, is , am) = [1. 1. 0.] >= antecedent C(3S or 3S, am, is ) = [-1. -1.  0.]
      consequent C(3S or 3S, is , are (null)) = [ 1.  1. -1.] >= antecedent C(3S or 3S, am, are (null)) = [ 0.  0. -1.]
- Does the ME necessary candidate condition hold?
    YES, because m_hat = 2 and m = 2 and therefore m_hat <= m.
- Does the ME first necessary constraint condition hold?
    YES, because m = m_hat = 2 and the sum of the consequent difference vector is
      [ 2.  2. -1.]
    which is indeed larger than the sum of the antecedent difference vectors which is
      [-1. -1. -1.]
- Does the ME second necessary constraint condition hold?
    YES, because the categorical trivial sufficient condition without rescaling actually holds.
- Does the first corollary of the ME second necessary constraint condition hold?
    YES
- Does the second corollary of the ME second necessary constraint condition hold?
    YES
- Does the ME trivial sufficient condition hold?
    YES, because each consequent difference vector can be paired up with a
    smaller antecedent difference vector with no repetitions, for instance as follows:

      C(1S or 3S, is , are (null)) = [ 1.  0. -1.]
- Does the first corollary of the ME second necessary constraint condition hold?

- Is the antecedent mapping feasible?
    The antecedent mapping is OT feasible and therefore also HG feasible.
- Does the categorical trivial sufficient condition without rescaling hold?
    YES, because each consequent difference vector can be paired up with a
    smaller antecedent difference vector (possibly with repetitions), for instance as follows:

- Does the ME necessary candidate condition hold?
    YES, because m_hat = 2 and m = 2 and therefore m_hat <= m.
- Does the ME first necessary constraint condition hold?
    YES, because m = m_hat = 2 and the sum of the consequent difference vector is

    which is indeed larger than the sum of the antecedent difference vectors which is

- Is the antecedent mapping feasible?
    The antecedent mapping is OT feasible and therefore also HG feasible.

    NO, because for instance the consequent difference vector

- Does the categorical trivial sufficient condition with rescaling hold?
    YES, because each consequent difference vector can be paired up with a

    which is not larger than the sum of the antecedent difference vectors which is
      [ 2.  0. -1.]

      C(1P or 3S, is , are (null)) = [ 1.  0. -1.]
- Does the first corollary of the ME second necessary constraint condition hold?
    NO, because for instance the constraint agree-close
      assigns 0 violations to the antecedent mapping
      but it assigns 1.0 violations to the consequent mapping
- Does the second corollary of the ME second necessary constraint condition hold?
    YES

- This is an HG T-order because the antecedent mapping is HG unfeasible.
- Does the ME necessary candidate condition hold?
    YES, because m_hat = 2 and m = 2 and therefore m_hat <= m.
- Does the ME first necessary constraint condition hold?
    NO, because m = m_hat = 2 but the sum of the consequent difference vectors is

    as the antecedent difference vectors are as follows:

(1P or 3P, are (null) ) -> (1S or 1P, are (null) )
- The antecedent difference vectors are the following:
    C(1P or 3P, are (null) , am) = [0. 0. 1.]
    C(1P or 3P, are (null) , is) = [0. 0. 1.]
  and the consequent difference vectors are the following:
    C(1S or 1P, are (null) , am) = [0. 0. 1.]
    C(1S or 1P, are (null) , is) = [0. 0. 1.]
- Is the antecedent mapping feasible?
    The antecedent mapping is OT feasible and therefore also HG feasible.
- Does the categorical trivial sufficient condition without rescaling hold?
    YES, because each consequent difference vector can be paired up with a
    smaller antecedent difference vector (possibly with repetitions), for instance as follows:
      consequent C(1S or 1P, are (null) , am) = [0. 0. 1.] >= antecedent C(1P or 3P, are (null) , am) = [0. 0. 1.]
      consequent C(1S or 1P, are (null) , is) = [0. 0. 1.] >= antecedent C(1P or 3P, are (null) , am) = [0. 0. 1.]
- Does the ME necessary candidate condition hold?
    YES, because m_hat = 2 and m = 2 and therefore m_hat <= m.
- Does the ME first necessary constraint condition hold?
    YES, because m = m_hat = 2 and the sum of the consequent difference vector is
      [0. 0. 2.]
    which is indeed larger than the sum of the antecedent difference vectors which is
      [0. 0. 2.]
- Does the ME second necessary constraint condition hold?
    YES, because the categorical trivial sufficient condition without rescaling actually holds.
- Does the first corollary of the ME second necessary constraint condition hold?
    YES
- Does the second corollary of the ME second necessary constraint condition hold?
    YES
- Does the ME trivial sufficient condition hold?
    YES, because each consequent difference vector can be paired up with a
    smaller antecedent difference vector with no repetitions, for instance as follows:
      consequent C(1S or 1P, are (null) , am) = [0. 0. 1.] >= antecedent C(1P or 3P, are (null) , am) = [0. 0. 1.]
      consequent C(1S or 1P, are (null) , is) = [0. 0. 1.] >= antecedent C(1P or 3P, are (null) , is) = [0. 0. 1.]

    YES, because m_hat = 2 and m = 2 and therefore m_hat <= m.

      [0. 0. 2.]
